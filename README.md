I can't work out how to do the two circuits on one board with the connections that you can add and remove.  So I've made two separate boards.  


I wanted you to have alook before I wire it up on Kicad as at the moment I'm not sure if I've got it right and some connections seem wrong

e.g the connections out of the board that is in series  have been connected together on the pcb - by KICAD - do I need  to change it in the schematic or can I do that in the wiring?
